# Effects of Room Parameters on Learning Performance

A healthy and comfortable indoor climate is a crucial foundation for successful teaching and effective learning. In particular, in classrooms and smaller lecture halls with high occupant density, factors such as room temperature, relative humidity, and the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) directly affect the well-being, health and cognitive performance of those present. Numerous scientific studies show that an optimally set indoor climate not only improves subjective comfort but also enables measurable gains in concentration and learning performance.

## Room Temperature and Cognitive Performance

The temperature in indoor spaces plays a central role in students performance. Studies in European schools have shown that pupils’ cognitive performance improves significantly when room temperature is lowered from 30 °C to 20 °C (Pawel Wargocki, 2012, p. 582). Likewise, very low relative humidity can irritate the respiratory tract and increase the risk of infections.  
At temperatures between 20 and 22 °C, most people feel comfortable and can concentrate optimally.  
However, when the temperature rises above 25 °C, productivity subconsciously decreases by about 1 to 2 % per additional degree Celsius (Pawel Wargocki, 2012, p. 586). At extreme temperatures above 30 °C, physical complaints such as heat stress, accelerated pulse and rapid fatigue also occur. Children are particularly sensitive to high temperatures, leading to observed fatigue, declining attention and an increased error rate in tasks in overheated classrooms.

## Relative Humidity and Health

Humidity also significantly influences comfort and health indoors. A range of 40 to 60 % relative humidity is considered ideal (Peder Wolkoff, 2007, p. 854). At humidity levels below 30 %, mucous membranes dry out, leading to irritated eyes, dry throat and increased infection risk. At the same time, the respiratory tract’s ability to defend against pollutants and pathogens is reduced.  
Conversely, high humidity above 60 % promotes mold growth, which in turn increases the risk of respiratory diseases and allergies. High humidity also impairs the body’s temperature regulation, as sweat evaporates less effectively.

## CO₂ Concentration and Cognitive Performance

CO₂ concentration in classrooms is a key indicator of air quality and ventilation needs. While fresh outdoor air contains about 420 ppm CO₂ (as of 2023), indoor levels should ideally remain below 1000 ppm. Even at concentrations of 1000 ppm, first complaints such as fatigue and difficulty concentrating occur (Wargocki Pawel, 2017). Levels above 2000 ppm can lead to headaches, dizziness and nausea. Moreover, CO₂ concentration has a huge impact on attendance. For every 1000 ppm increase in CO₂, absence rises by 10–20 % (D. G. Shendell, 2004).  
Regular ventilation approximately every 20 to 45 minutes or the use of mechanical ventilation systems is necessary to keep CO₂ levels at a healthy level. Good ventilation not only lowers CO₂ but also reduces sick days and improves learning performance.

## Noise Level and Concentration in Class

In addition to temperature, humidity and air quality, noise level also has a significant effect on students’ learning and working ability. Acoustic disturbances from conversations, street noise or technical equipment cause students attention to wane and impair their cognitive performance. Even at a continuous sound level of about 50 dB(A), comparable to normal conversational noise, many students begin to work slower and make more errors (Daniel Connolly, 2019). Background noises that overlap speech are particularly detrimental to understanding instructional content. This is especially problematic for younger children and non-native speakers, as they rely more on clear acoustic perception. Studies show that speech intelligibility in the classroom decreases once the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) falls below +15 dB (Maria Klatte, 2010). Prolonged high noise levels can also trigger stress reactions: increased blood pressure, elevated pulse and the release of stress hormones impair not only learning ability but also students’ long-term health.

## Conclusion

In summary, an optimal indoor climate is essential for students’ health, well-being and learning ability. Based on the researched optimal values, a set of guidelines has been developed:

**Temperature Management**  
-	Optimal air temperature between 20 and 22 °C   
-	Implement cooling or shading strategies if indoor temperature exceeds 25 °C  
-	Avoid direct sunlight by using blinds or shades in warm/sunny weather

**Humidity Control**  
-	Optimal relative humidity between 40 and 60 %  
-	Use humidifiers if RH < 40 %  
-	Ventilate regularly or use dehumidifiers if RH > 60 %  
-	Watch for signs of mold growth at high humidity levels to prevent health risks

**CO₂ Reduction through Ventilation**  
-	CO₂ level should be < 1000 ppm  
-	Perform shock ventilation when levels exceed 1000 ppm  

**Noise Reduction**  
-	Keep ambient noise at a maximum of 50 dB(A)  
-	Signal-to-noise ratio of at least +15 dB  
-	Keep windows facing busy streets closed during lessons  
-	Minimize background noise from technical equipment
