## Problem Description

**Problem Description**
Often, students in classrooms felt that they had difficulty learning.

### Problem Statement Worksheet
- **Who does the problem affect?:** Students and Lecturers (indirectly)
- **What does the problem affect? What are the factors of the problem?:** Concentration problems => Impaired learning ability (**Drivers from student interviews:** Temperature, stuffiness => Air quality (CO2, humidity), noise level)
- **Why is solving the problem important?:** To optimally achieve the goal of studying (learning).
- **Where does the problem lie or where does it have influence:** The problem particularly lies in the fact that poor room quality only becomes a burden/noticeable during prolonged use => Especially problematic for in-person studies, like at DHBW
- **When did the problem start? When does it need to be solved:** Since the beginning of studies => But unevenly (e.g., temperature in summer)
- **How was the problem created? How can it be solved:** The problem naturally occurs in closed rooms (especially with many people) => Actively counteract it (ventilation, notes on volume, etc.) => **Changing rooms, etc., is not a solution due to the effort involved**

## Stakeholders
1. Students => Have an interest in room quality (and thus in improvement through the system to be developed)
2. Developers => Have an interest in project success
3. Lecturers => Have an interest in room quality to ensure optimal teaching
4. Study Program Organization Team => Has an interest in improving room quality to enable optimal teaching
5. Partner Company (Student) => Has an interest in the best possible education for its students

---

## Goals
1. Improve the learning environment
2. Cause identification => Continuous improvement of the environment

---

## Use Cases
1. The system is used during lectures / exams in rooms to continuously improve the learning environment.
2. The system is used to retrospectively identify problems.

---

## Functional Requirements
### Monitoring
1. The system must collect room quality data (temperature, CO2 content of the air, humidity, noise level) at regular intervals and make it retrievable.

### Analysis / Interpretability
1. The system must analyze the collected data and provide current recommendations for action to improve the learning environment.
2. The system must visually prepare the data for better readability and interpretability.

### Operation
1. The system must provide the interpretable data and analyses within the DHBW Digital Campus.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Monitoring
1. The system must make the cyclically collected room quality data (and recommendations) retrievable within 5 minutes of collection.
2. The system must persistently store the collected room quality data.
3. The system must provide data of high quality regarding comprehensibility (unit), timeliness (see NFR 1), appropriateness, and correctness.

### Analysis / Interpretability
1. The system may only issue truly beneficial (with regard to room climate) recommendations for action.
2. The system must clearly distinguish current data from past data.

### Operation
1. The system must be fully operable without the use of a keyboard.

# Proposed Solutions
In principle: Sensor data must be collected and persisted (project requirement)

## Improvement of Room Climate
### Automated Actions
Based on the collected data, actuators should be triggered here, for example, to improve the room climate => Window openers, traffic light for noise recommendations, etc.

### Dashboard
Based on the collected data, recommendations for action as well as current data should be displayed here. This can be accessed from the Digital Campus.

### Regular Room Change with Breaks
Rooms should be regularly rotated with ventilation => Climate improvement. The noise level should be reduced by means of breaks.

**Since our team does not have any influence on the management of rooms within DHBW this solution is not applicable**

## Monitoring of Room Quality Data
### Dashboard
The collected data is displayed within a web dashboard and retrieved via frontend elements (without text input => NFR).

### Reporting in Filesystem
The collected data is regularly transferred to a filesystem in a suitable file format (e.g., PDF for tables, diagrams, etc.).

# Selection of Solution
The selection of a final solution was developed by a focus-area matrix. We propose 4 important (development focused) categories that are graded (rough estimation 0-5) for each possible solution. The categories are independent from the declared requirements, since all possible solutions are capable of implementing the specified requirements.

The focus-area matrix recommends the usage of a full dashboard approach for each monitoring and recommendation specific problem solutions.
