# Sampling-Rate and -Strategy
This chapter discusses our selection of sampling rates and it's decision way. We do this by examining which sensors we have and what could be a minimum / maximum reasonable sampling time for our use case. Then we calculate the data amount for our project period of around 60 days in order to finally decide our sampling rate / strategy.

<b>This chapter defines the sampling rate that each hardware uses to fetch sensor data AND the transmission rate on which those points are sent to the MQTT Broker</b>

## Reasonable transmission rate by Sensor
We identified the sound sensor as most critical sensor regarding sampling time, due to two reasons:

1. The sensor measures sound by a sine wave, therefore we must first aggregate multiple values in order to calculate the sound level (multiply points at 20hz sampling are already enough based on public information)
2. In order to generate a proper recommendation regarding the sound level of a room multiple datapoints are needed because only a constantly high sound level is relevant regarding study quality.

Therefore our transmission rate can't be set below 1/20s (Reason 1) and should be high enough in order to measure a constant sound level of a room instead of some spikes (plane, door slams, pitches, etc.)

In order to comply with those requirements we discussed to have a final transmission rate between the intervall of <b>[1s; 5min]</b>.

The other sensors definitely do not a data rate in this intervall. Those could be even higher (since our use case does not need such high resolution data -> goal: recommendations) therefore we do not focus on those anymore.

## Calculation of data volume in database by point
Our goal is to have raw datapoints within the database. We do not want to lose information if we don't have to especially due to the machine learning use case. Therefore all reasonable statistical calculation shall be performed in a second table (called silver). Therefore if we have a transmission rate of f.e. 30 seconds for the MQTT Broker, each sent message contains a vector of data points (collected in intervalls of sampling rate of each sensor). The timestamp then refers only to the moment on which the mqtt message was sent from each arduino to the broker. By that we can extrapolate each timestamp of the collected sensor data if needed.

In order to select a final transmission rate we calculated the following data volumes (lines in table) for each transmission rate and time period of 60 days (project run time)

1. ~86k -> 1 min
2. ~172k -> 30s
3. ~345k -> 15s
4. ~860k -> 10s

Based on the fact that none of the data volumes is generally considered high, we chose a rate of 30s. It lies on the lower intervall of the critical sound sensor, therefore we should have enough data to aggregate a final usable value from. Since the data volume only amounts to 172k it also shouldn't result in any problem to send (perhaps unnecessary) high resolution data from the other sensors as well.

## Sampling Rate
Within those 30 seconds we sample each datapoint as follows:

1. Sound Sensor: 1s -> Vector[30]
2. Humidity: 30s -> Vector[1]  
3. Temperature: 30s -> Vector[1]
4. VOC: 5s -> Vector[6]

Later we aggregate those data within the database / rules in order to reduce outliers. Our first priority is to ensure no loss of information.
