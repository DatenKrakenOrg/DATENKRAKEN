# Slim Quality Checklist

Scope: Rapid engineering health snapshot (implementation-focused, excludes long-term roadmap items).

## 1. Documentation
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Chapter 10 fully in English | ✅ | Filenames + content aligned |
| Alerting scope realism (no overclaim) | ✅ | Future items clearly scoped |
| PDF build (chapter-only) | ✅ | mkdocs-pdf config independent |

## 2. Observability & Reliability
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Inactivity watchdog email | ✅ | Recovery mail included |
| Sequence anomaly email | ✅ | Cooldown logic present |
| State persistence | ❌ | Planned (sensor_status) |
| Metrics export (MTTD etc.) | ❌ | Not yet |

## 3. Deployment
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Unified compose workflow | ✅ | One command startup |
| Healthchecks (core services) | ⚠️ | Partial, extend DB + frontend |
| Version pinning | ⚠️ | Review tags policy |

## 4. Frontend Resilience
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Stale data indicator | ✅ | Timestamp + label |
| Connection state machine | ✅ | Active/Degraded/Offline model |
| Graceful degradation path | ✅ | Fallback hierarchy defined |
| Circuit breaker | ❌ | Future enhancement |

## 5. Testing & Quality
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| JSON message tests | ✅ | Covered in test suite |
| Alert logic unit tests | ⚠️ | Partial coverage (cooldowns) |
| Link integrity (chapter 10) | ⚠️ | Run after filename swap |
| Automation for PDF | ❌ | Manual trigger currently |

## 6. Risk / SFMEA Evolution
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| New failure modes documented | ✅ | FA13 added |
| RPN recalculation transparency | ✅ | Extended table |
| Mitigation alignment | ✅ | Consistent with actual code |

## 7. Backlog Focus (Top 5)
| Priority | Item | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Persist alert states/events | Enable history + metrics |
| 2 | Metrics export (Prometheus) | Quantify detection performance |
| 3 | Healthcheck completion | Earlier failure surfacing |
| 4 | PDF build automation | Consistency & CI artifact |
| 5 | Frontend circuit breaker | Isolate repeated failures |

## 8. KPI Snapshot (Current Feasible)
| KPI | Current | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Inactivity detection latency | ≈ threshold | < 1.2× threshold |
| False inactivity alerts | Low (manual observation) | < 5% |
| Reconnect success ratio | n/a | > 90% |

## 9. Immediate Next Steps
1. Update nav to English filenames only.
2. Remove legacy German-named duplicates (post link check).
3. Add link integrity validation (script / CI step).
4. Decide on stable cover logo approach (optional fallback).
