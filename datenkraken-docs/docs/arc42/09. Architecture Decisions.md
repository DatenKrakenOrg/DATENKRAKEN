Design Decisions 
================
The following section shows our architectural decisions by sprints (initially introduced -> edits below), and their implication:

## Sprint 1

### ADR 1.1: Usage of NTP Server
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Section</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>17.07.2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Context</td>
      <td>The usage of the NTP server was first thought to be made on a edge device (f.e. ESP32). This was cancelled because of the following reason.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Decision</td>
      <td>The decision was made since a NTP server call on the side of ESP32 would result in a loss of information (complete loss or inaccuracy of timestamp for collection time of a data point)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Consequences</td>
      <td>It moves the implementation of a edge device to later phases of the project => This means that we may run out of time if we still want to use one.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### ADR 1.2: Subscription script in Persistence-Compose
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Section</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>17.07.2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Context</td>
      <td>A script is needed to forward the data from the mqtt broker towards the database. This step is done via a script within the persistence compose (the same as the database).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Decision</td>
      <td>The decision a strong connectivity between database and the script since its held within the same network. Other than that the structure is more clear than holding it in two different composes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Proposed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Consequences</td>
      <td>This means that if components of the compose must be replaced the script and/or the database must be stopped to. For now this should not be a problem since the mqtt broker can hold data until fetched (QOS). It's not 100% clear whether this setting is set, so this decision might change.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### ADR 1.3: TimescaleDB / Medaillon architecture of database
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Section</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>17.07.2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Context</td>
      <td>TimescaleDB is used for storing the time series sensor data. It's architecture is based on the medaillon architecture. Bronze layer is suppossed to be a table, but silver / gold layer is suppossed to be a materialized view.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Decision</td>
      <td>The decision to use timescaledb is made since, all group members are familiar with sql, whilst still having sota timeseries performance. The medaillon architecture ensures NFR 1.2 (bronze layer) and NFR 1.3 (silver layer). A materialized view is used since it ensures that less overhead is needed (tables would propose replication), by that we can ensure NFR 1.2 by backing up the bronze layer table => Silver and Gold layer can be restored on compute time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Consequences</td>
      <td>This means that all of data cleaning must be done within the database. No external scripts can be used since of the usage of materialized views.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Sprint 2

### ADR 1.1: Usage of NTP Server
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Section</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>22.07.2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Context</td>
      <td>We set the transmission rate of each message (by sensor) to a rate 30s / message</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Decision</td>
      <td>The decision was made by calculating the final data volume for a time period of 60 days (project run time)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Consequences</td>
      <td>It implicates a aggregation of datapoints on periods of 30s intervalls. And a data volume of roughly 172k lines per table.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

      <td>Context</td>
      <td>We set the sampling rate of each sensor to: Sound Sensor: 1s -> Vector[30], Humidity: 30s -> Vector[1], Temperature: 30s -> Vector[1]
VOC: 5s -> Vector[6]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Decision</td>
      <td>The decision was made by calculating the estimating the probability of outliers for each sensor (in order to have enough data to aggregate data to reduce outliers)</td>

      <td>Status</td>
      <td>Accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Consequences</td>
