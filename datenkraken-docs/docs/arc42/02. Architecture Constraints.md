# Architecture Constraints

### **Technical Constraints**
| Topic | Constraint | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Programming language for microcontroller | C++ | Provides best compatibility and is the standard for Arduino programming |
| Operating systems | Must be executable on all major operating systems | Ensures maximum compatibility |
| Hardware requirements | Sensor data is collected using an Arduino | Chosen for simplicity, availability, and compatibility with sensors |
| Communication protocols | Sensor data is published to an MQTT broker | Enables other teams to access and use our sensor data |
| Testing requirements | Code coverage â‰¥ 75% | Helps identify bugs early and improves code quality |

### **Organizational / Political Constraints**
| Topic | Constraint | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Project methodology | Scrum | Central project management tool for task distribution |
| Decision-making processes | Architecture decisions must be made together with the team | Encourages discussion to avoid oversight and mistakes |

### **Conventions / Standards**
| Topic | Constraint | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Naming conventions | camelCase | Improves code readability and consistency |
| Branch naming conventions | Branches are named using *(e.g. feat / docs)/(feature name)*, e.g. `docs/constraints` | Clear differentiation between branches |
| Pull requests | Must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer | To catch errors and gather suggestions before merging into main |
| Documentation | mkdocs | Standardized and easy-to-use tool for project documentation |
| Commit messages | *(e.g. feat / docs): (what was done)*, e.g. `docs: added arc42 template` | Clear and understandable commit history |
