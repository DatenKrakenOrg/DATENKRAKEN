# Frontend Documentation

This Document describes how the frontend works and what role every necessary file plays. It will also be explained how to start it. 

## General Information 
The Frontend is coded using a variety of Librarys like for example Streamlit. Instead of installing every Dependency individually, the user can run the command 'uv sync' inside the folder 'frontend' (if uv is installed). After that the command 'uv run streamlit run app.py' starts the frontend (Only if ran from inside the frontend folder). If everything was done correctly, a new browser window will automatically pop up, showing the content.

## app.py 
App.py represents the main/landing page. It functions as a generel and quick overview over the rooms which are being meassured. It shows the current value ov every meassured parameter and the current status of the room which is defined by the 'worst' current value. That means that if one Parameter is in the critical range, the room status is displayed as critical. Indepth pages are also initiated in here via page_definition package.

## page_definition
The package 'page_definition' withholds the detailed views of the corresponding rooms. The general overview page is defined via the overview module, whilst the indepth pages are defined via the submodule generic_analytics page.

## Utils / Widgets / Database
Those packages primarily provide functionality to gather and augment data (Utils / Database) and show them on the ui (widgets). **For a deeper understanding, we HIGHLY recommend taking a look in the code. Every function is documented. Don't forget to take a look at the test cases in order to find out how functions should be used!**
