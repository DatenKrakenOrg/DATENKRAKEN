# Frontend Documentation

This Document describes how the frontend works and what role every necessary file plays. It will also be explained how to start it. 

## General Information 
The Frontend is coded using a variety of Librarys like for example Streamlit. Instead of installing every Dependency individually, the user can run the command 'uv sync' inside the folder 'frontend' (if uv is installed). After that the command 'uv run streamlit run app.py' starts the frontend (Only if ran from inside the frontend folder). If everything was done correctly, a new browser window will automatically pop up, showing the content.

## app.py 
App.py represents the main/landing page. It functions as a generel and quick overview over the rooms which are being meassured. It shows the current value ov every meassured parameter and the current status of the room which is defined by the 'worst' current value. That means that if one Parameter is in the critical range, the room status is displayed as critical. Indepth pages are also initiated in here via page_definition package.

## page_definition
The package 'page_definition' withholds the detailed views of the corresponding rooms. The general overview page is defined via the overview module, whilst the indepth pages are defined via the submodule generic_analytics page.

## Utils / Widgets / Database
Those packages primarily provide functionality to gather and augment data (Utils / Database) and show them on the ui (widgets). **For a deeper understanding, we HIGHLY recommend taking a look in the code. Every function is documented. Don't forget to take a look at the test cases in order to find out how functions should be used!**

## Resilience & Error Handling

The frontend contains several mechanisms to remain usable and informative even when underlying services (database, external APIs) degrade. Below is an overview of the implemented strategies.

### 1. Database Query Behavior
All low-level selection helpers (`commit_select`, `commit_select_scalar`) return an empty list `[]` on execution errors while logging the underlying exception. This keeps callers simple (`if not rows:` works for both *no data* and *error* states) and prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing pages.

### 2. Database Health Check
`is_db_healthy()` performs a lightweight `SELECT 1` to distinguish between:
- Database unreachable / credentials invalid → show a clear error panel
- Database reachable but empty → show an empty-state message instead of a technical error

### 3. Unified Error Panels
`render_error_panel(title, details)` provides a consistent visual block for: missing data, connectivity failures, or unavailable subsystems. This improves scanability and reduces ad‑hoc `st.error()` scattering.

### 4. Staleness & Freshness Logic
The staleness helpers (e.g. `temperature_below_five_minutes`) now:
- Normalize timestamps to UTC
- Tolerate small clock skews by using the absolute delta
- Treat absence of data as stale (False) with a logged hint

### 5. Time Series Robustness
The history widget guards:
- Empty DataFrames (shows a warning instead of calling `.min()` / `.max()` on empty data)
- Exceptions during fetch (shows an inline error and aborts the widget render)
- Uses timezone-aware timestamps to avoid inconsistent range calculations.

### 6. External API (Weather) Degradation
Weather fetch failures surface as `st.info("Weather data temporarily unavailable.")` rather than a console print. Downstream recommendation logic is skipped when data is absent, preventing secondary errors.

### 7. Progressive User Feedback
Toasts (success notifications) are only emitted when:
- At least one valid sensor value exists
- Database health check passes
- A per-session / per-room toast flag is not yet set (prevents notification spam)

### 8. Severity Color Coding
- `st.error` (Red): Hard failure (DB unreachable, fatal query error)
- `st.warning` (Yellow): Staleness or non-critical data quality issues
- `st.info` (Blue): Temporary unavailability (e.g. weather API) or suppressed diagnostics
- `st.toast` (Green): Successful load confirmation

### 9. Rationale
The layered fallback approach reduces alarm fatigue: true infrastructure problems are visually distinct, while normal early-phase empty data or transient external API hiccups remain low-noise. Returning empty lists (instead of raising) keeps caller code linear and prevents fragmented error handling.

### 10. Future Enhancements
- Export metrics (health counters, last failure timestamps)
- Distinguish "no data yet" vs. "filtered range empty" in analytics views
- Progressive backoff / circuit breaker on repeated DB failures
- Optional observability integration (Sentry / OpenTelemetry)
- Configurable strict mode to differentiate error vs. empty result explicitly
